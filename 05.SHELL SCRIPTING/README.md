## Shell Scripting Hands-on Projects

Bash scripts are essentially a series of commands and instructions that are executed sequentially in a shell. You can create a shell script by saving a collection of commands in atext file with a .sh extension.

### Variables
Variables can store data or value of various types such as numbers, strings, and arrays.

### Command Substitution
This allows you to capture the output of a command and use it as a value within your script. You can use backtick or the $()syntax for command substitution.
